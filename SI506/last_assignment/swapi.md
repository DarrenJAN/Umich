* Available: Thursday, 14 April 2022, 4:00 PM Eastern
* Due: on or before Tuesday, 26 April 2022, 11:59 PM Eastern

:exclamation: No late submissions will be accepted for scoring.

## 2.0 Overview

The last assignment is open network, open readings, and open notes. You may refer to
code in previous lecture exercises, lab exercises, and problem sets for inspiration.

See the `last_assignment_overview.pdf` document for more details regarding this assignment.

## 3.0 Points

The last assignment is worth __1700__ points and you accumulate points by passing a series of
autograder tests.

## 4.0 Solo effort

:exclamation: You are prohibited from soliciting assistance or accepting assistance from
any person while completing the programming assignment. The code that you submit _must_ be
your own work. Likewise, you are prohibited from assisting any other student required to complete
this assignment. This includes those attempting the assignment during the regular exam period, as
well as those who may attempt the assignment at another time and/or place due to scheduling
conflicts or other issues.

:exclamation: If you have formed or participate in an SI 506 study group please suspend all study
group activities for the duration of the last assignment.

## 5.0 Files

In line with the weekly lab exercises and problem sets you will be provided with a number of
files:

1. `swapi.md`: assignment instructions
2. `swapi.py`: script including a `main()` function and other definitions and statements
3. `sw_utils.py`: module containing utility functions and constants
4. One or more `*.csv` and/or `*.json` files that contain assignment data
5. One or more `fxt_*.json` test fixture files that you must match with the files you produce

Please download the assignment files from Canvas Files as soon as they are released. This is a timed
event and delays in acquiring the assignment files will shorten the time available to engage with
the challenges. The clock is not your friend.

:exclamation: _DO NOT_ modify or remove the scaffolded code that we provide in the Python script or
module files unless instructed to do so.

## 5.1 Module imports

The template file `swapi.py` includes a single `import` statement:

```python
import sw_utils as utl
```

The utilities module `sw_utils.py` includes the following `import` statements:

```python
import copy
import csv
import json
import requests

from urllib.parse import quote, urlencode, urljoin
```

:exclamation: __Do not__ comment out or remove these `import` statements. That said, check your
`import` statements periodically. If you discover that other `import` statements have been added to
your Python files remove them. In such cases, VS Code is attempting to assist you by inserting
additional `import` statements based on your keystrokes. Their presence can trigger
`ModuleNotFoundError` runtime exceptions when you submit your code to Gradescope.

## 6.0 Data

The Star Wars saga has spawned films, animated series, books, music, artwork, toys, games, fandom
websites, cosplayers, scientific names for new organisms (e.g.,
[_Trigonopterus yoda_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonopterus_yoda)), and even a Darth Vader
_grotesque_ attached to the
[northwest tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader_grotesque#/media/File:Darth_vader_grotesque.jpg)
of the Washington National Cathedral. Leading US news sources such as the
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) cover the Star Wars phenomenon on a regular basis.

The last assignment adds yet another Star Wars-inspired artifact to the list. The data used in this
assignment is sourced from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.py4e.com/) (SWAPI),
[Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page),
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/star-wars).

Besides retrieving data from SWAPI you will also access information locally from the following data
files:

* `clone_wars.csv`
* `clone_wars_episodes.csv`
* `nyt_star_wars_articles.json`
* `wookieepedia_droids.json`
* `wookieepedia_people.json`
* `wookieepedia_planets.csv`
* `wookieepedia_starships.csv`

## 7.0 Debugging

As you write your code take advantage of the built-in `print` function, VS code's debugger, and VS
Codes file comparison feature to check your work and debug your code. See the `last_assignment_overview.pdf`
for additional details and instructions.

## 8.0 Gradescope submissions

You may submit your solution to Gradescope as many times as needed before the expiration of
the exam time. Your __final__ submission will constitute your exam submission.

:exclamation: You _must_ submit your solution file to _Gradescope_ before the expiration of exam
time. Solution files submitted to the teaching team after the expiration of exam time will receive
a score of zero (0).

If you are unable to earn full points on the assignment the teaching team will grade your submission
__manually__. Partial credit __may__ be awarded for submissions that fail one or more autograder
tests if the teaching team (at their sole discretion) deem a score adjustment warranted.

If you submit a partial solution, feel free to include comments (if you have time) that explain
what you were attempting to accomplish in the area(s) of the program that are not working properly.
We will review your comments when determining partial credit.

## 9.0 Challenges

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there occured the Clone Wars (22-19 BBY), a major
conflict that pitted the [Galatic Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic)
against the breakaway
[Separatist Alliance](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems). The
Republic fielded genetically modified human clone troopers commanded by members of the Jedi order
against Separatist battle droids. The struggle was waged across the galaxy and, in time, inspired an
animated television series entitled
[_Star Wars: The Clone Wars_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars) which
debuted in October 2008 and ran for seven seasons (2008-2014, 2020).

__Challenge 01__ features a small _Clone Wars_ data set that provides general information about each
season. You will use it to demonstrate your indexing and slicing skills.

__Challenge 02__ implement a number of `utl.convert_to_*` functions employing `try` and `except`
blocks that will be employed in later challenges.

__Challenges 03-06__ utilize a second _Clone Wars_ data set that provides summary data about the
first two seasons of the animated series. You will implement a number of functions that will
simplify interacting with the data in order to surface basic information about the episodes and
their directors, writers, and viewership.

__Challenges 07-09__ work with New York Times article data (1977-2022) that charts the creative,
cultural, and economic impact of the _Star Wars_ saga both within the US and elsewhere over the past
forty-five years.

__Challenges 10-18__ recreate the escape of the light freighter
[_Twilight_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight) from the sabotaged and doomed Separatist
heavy cruiser [_Malevolence_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malevolence) which took place
during the first year of the conflict (22 BBY). Your task is to reassemble the crew of the
_Twilight_ and take on passengers before disengaging from the _Malevolence_ and heading into deep
space. The Jedi generals [Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker) and
[Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi) together with the astromech droid
(robot) [R2-D2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2) had earlier boarded the _Malevolence_
after maneuvering the much smaller _Twilight_ up against the heavy cruiser and
docking via an emergency air lock. Their mission was twofold:

   1. Retrieve the Republican Senator
      [Padm√© Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala) and the protocol
      (communications) droid [C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO) whose ship had been
      seized after being caught in the _Malevolence's_ tractor beam, and
   2. Sabotage the warship.

In these challenges you will implement functions and follow a workflow that generates a JSON
document that recreates the _Twilight's_ escape from the _Malevolence_.

__Caching__: This assignment utilizes a local "cache" dictionary located in the utilities module
that eliminates redundant HTTP GET requests made to SWAPI by storing the SWAPI responses locally.
The caching workflow is implemented _fully_ and all you need do is call the function
`utl.get_resource` whenever you need to retrieve a SWAPI representation of a person/droid,
planet, species, or starship.

:exclamation: _Do not_ call `get_swapi_resource` directly. Doing so sidesteps the
cache and undercuts the built-in caching optimization strategy.

The cache dictionary is written to a JSON file every time you run `swapi.py`:

```python
# PERSIST CACHE (DO NOT COMMENT OUT)
utl.write_json(utl.CACHE_FILEPATH, utl.cache)
```

The cache JSON document will remain empty until you start working on Challenge 12. Thereafter the
cache file will record resources retrieved from SWAPI.

May the Force be with You.

## 9.1 Challenge 01

__Task__: Refactor (e.g., modify) the function `utl.read_csv` to use a list comprehension and then
call the function to read a small CSV file that contains general information about the first seven
(`7`) seasons of the _The Clone Wars_ animated series.

:exclamation: Inspect `clone_wars.csv` visually in order to complete Challenge 01.

## 9.1.1 refactor `utl.read_csv`

Examine the commented out code in `utl.read_csv` function (__do not__ uncomment). Reimplement the
function by writing code in the `with` block that retrieves a `csv` reader object and employs a
__list comprehension__ to traverse the rows in the reader object and return a new list of row
elements to the caller.

### Requirements

1. You are limited to writing two (2) lines of code.

   1. Line 01 assigns the "reader" object returned by calling `csv.reader` to a variable named
     `reader`.
   2. Line 02 returns a new list of `reader` "row" elements to the caller using
      __a list comprehension__.

2. You _must_ employ existing variable names that appear in the commented out code when writing
   your list comprehension (i.e., `reader`, `row`).

## 9.1.2 Call function

After refactoring `utl.read_csv` return to `main`. Call the function and retrieve the data contained
in the file `clone_wars.csv`. Assign the return value to a variable named `clone_wars`.

Call the built-in function `print()` and pass `clone_wars` to it. Confirm that the data is stored
in a list of lists. Comment out `print()` once confirmed.

:exclamation: Review lecture notes and code solution files if you have forgotten how to write a list
comprehension. If you are unsuccessful in your endeavors uncomment the code in `utl.read_csv` and
get the function working so that you can continue with the assignment.

## 9.1.3 Indexing and slicing

:exclamation: Using a `for` loop is neither required __nor permitted__. You _must_ also __exclude__
_The Clone Wars_ "headers" list element when slicing the list.

1. In `main` employ slicing to access the subset of all _The Clone Wars_ seasons that feature
   twenty-two (22) episodes. Assign the list to a variable named `clone_wars_22`.

2. In `main` employ slicing to access the subset of _The Clone Wars_ seasons that either started
   _or_ ended during the year 2012. Assign the list to a variable named `clone_wars_2012`.

3. In `main` employ indexing to access _The Clone Wars_ season URL string that _does not_ include
   the substring "\_Season\_" in it. Assign the string to a variable named `clone_wars_url`.

4. In `main` employ slicing to access all _The Clone Wars_ even-numbered seasons. Assign the list
   to a variable named `clone_wars_even_num_seasons`.

## 9.2 Challenge 02

__Task__: Implement the functions `utl.convert_to_none`, `utl.convert_to_int`,
`utl.convert_to_float`, and `utl.convert_to_list`. Each function attempts to convert a passed in
`value` to a more appropriate type.

### 9.2.1 `utl.convert_to_none` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to `None`. Review
the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions
   whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. __Do not__ place code outside the `try`/`except`
   code blocks.

2. The function _must_ perform a __case-insensitive__ comparison between the passed in `value` and
   the items in the `utl.NONE_VALUES` tuple constant:

   ```python
   NONE_VALUES = ('', 'n/a', 'none', 'unknown')
   ```

   If a match is obtained inside the `try` block the function will return `None` to the caller,
   otherwise, the value will be returned unchanged.

   :exclamation: Don't assume that `value` is "clean"; program defensively and remove
   leading/trailing spaces before checking if the "cleaned" version of the string matches a
   `utl.NONE_VALUES` item.

3. If a runtime exception is encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception and the
   `value` will be returned to the caller _unchanged_.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify a specific exception in the `except` statement.

## 9.2.2 `utl.convert_to_int` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to an `int`. Review
the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions
   whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. __Do not__ place code outside the `try`/`except`
   code blocks.

2. The function _must_ convert numbers masquerading as strings, incuding those with commas that
   represent a thousand separator:

   * "5" -> 5
   * "50,000" -> 50000
   * "5,000,000" -> 5000000

3. If a runtime exception is encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception, pass the
   `value` to the function `convert_to_none`, and then return the value returned by `convert_to_none` to
   the caller.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify a specific exception in the `except` statement.

## 9.2.3 `utl.convert_to_float` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to a `float`.
Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions
   whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. __Do not__ place code outside the `try`/`except`
   code blocks.

2. If a runtime exception is encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception, pass the
   `value` to the function `convert_to_none`, and then return the value returned by
   `convert_to_none` to the caller.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify a specific exception in the `except` statement.

## 9.2.4 `utl.convert_to_list` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to a `list` using a
`delimiter` if one is provided. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is
to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

:bulb: Model `convert_to_list` on the other type conversion functions. This challenge involves
adjusting your implementation per the hints below so that the function can handle converting
strings to lists or return the passed in value _unchanged_ if a runtime exception is encountered.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions
   whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. __Do not__ place code outside the `try`/`except`
   code blocks.

2. If the passed in `value` matches an item in the `utl.NONE_VALUES` tuple
   (__case-insensitive comparison__), the function _must_ return `None`.

3. If a delimiter value is provided the function will use it to split the `value`; otherwise, the
   string will be split without specifying a delimiter value.

   :bulb: Note that the function's `delimiter` parameter defaults to `None`. You _must_ check the
   truth value of `delimiter` in the function block. If `True` pass the delimiter value to the
   appropriate `str` method; otherwise rely on the `str` method's default behavior.

   :exclamation: Don't assume that `value` is "clean"; program defensively and remove
   leading/trailing spaces before attempting to convert the "cleaned" version of the string to a list.

4. If a runtime exception is encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception and the
   `value` will be returned to the caller _unchanged_.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify a specific exception in the `except` statement.

## 9.2.5 Call the functions

After implementing the four `utl.convert_to_*` functions return to `swapi.py`. In `main` test the
functions by calling each 2-3 times. Pass a value that can be converted and returned as a new type
and a couple of values that will trigger an exception and be returned unchanged. You can utilize the
built-in function `print()` to output each value to the terminal as illustrated by the following
example:

```python
print(f"\nconvert_to_none -> None = {utl.convert_to_none(' N/A ')}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_none -> None = {utl.convert_to_none('')}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_none -> no change = {utl.convert_to_none('Yoda ')}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_none -> no change = {utl.convert_to_none(5.5)}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_none -> no change = {utl.convert_to_none((1, 2, 3))}")

print(f"\nconvert_to_int -> int = {utl.convert_to_int('506 ')}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_int -> None = {utl.convert_to_int(' unknown')}")
print(f"\nconvert_to_int -> no change = {utl.convert_to_int([506, 507])}")

# Devise additional tests yourself for convert_to_float and convert_to_list
```

## 9.3 Challenge 03

__Task__: Refactor (e.g., modify) the function `utl.read_csv_to_dicts` to use a
__list comprehension__ and then call the function to read a CSV file that contains information about
the first two seasons of _Clone Wars_ episodes. Then implement the function `has_viewer_data` that
checks whether or not an episode possesses viewership information.

:bulb: This challenge has you working with a list of nested dictionaries. Use the built-in
function `print()` to explore the nested dictionary or call the function `utl.write_json` in `main`,
encode the data as JSON, and write it to a "test" JSON file so that you can view the list of
dictionaries more easily.

## 9.3.1 refactor `utl.read_csv_to_dicts`

Examine the commented out code in `utl.read_csv_to_dicts` function (__do not__ uncomment).
Reimplement the function by writing code in the `with` block that retrieves an instance of
`csv.DictReader` and employs a list comprehension to traverse the lines in the reader object and
return a new list of line elements to the caller.

### Requirements

1. You are limited to writing two (2) lines of code.

   1. Line 01 assigns an instance of `csv.DictReader` to a variable named `reader`.
   2. Line 02 returns a new list of `reader` "line" elements to the caller using
      __a list comprehension__.

2. You _must_ employ existing variable names that appear in the commented out code when writing
   your list comprehension (i.e., `reader`, `line`).

## 9.3.2 Call function

After refactoring `utl.read_csv_to_dicts` return to `main`. Call the function and retrieve the
data contained in the file `clone_wars_episodes.csv`. Assign the return value to a variable named
`clone_wars_episodes`.

:exclamation: Review lecture notes and code solution files if you have forgotten how to write a list
comprehension. If you are unsuccessful in your endeavors uncomment the code in `utl.read_csv_to_dicts`
and get the function working so that you can continue with the assignment.

## 9.3.3 `has_viewer_data` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that checks whether or not an individual _Clone Wars_ episode
possesses viewership information. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it
is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ compute the truth value of the passed in episode's "episode_us_viewers_mm"
   key-value pair, returning either `True` or `False` to the caller.

   :bulb: Recall that a function can include more than one `return` statement.

## 9.3.4 Call function

After implementing the function, return to `main`. Test your implementation of `has_viewer_data` by
counting the number of episodes in the `clone_wars_episodes` list that possess a
"episode_us_viewers_mm" numeric value. Whenever the return value of `has_viewer_data` equals `True`
increment your episode count by 1.

:bulb: Recall that a function call is considered an expression and `if` statements are composed of
one or more expressions.

:exclamation: The number of episodes that possess an "episode_us_viewers_mm" viewership value
equals twenty-five (`25`). If your loop does not accumulate this value, recheck both your
implementation of `has_viewer_data` and your `for` loop and loop block `if` statement.

## 9.4 Challenge 04

__Task__: Implement a function that converts Clone Wars episode string values to more appropriate
types.

## 9.4.1 `convert_episode_values` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that converts specifed string values to more appropriate types.
Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function accepts a list of nested "episode" dictionaries and you _must_ implement a nested
   loop to perform the value type conversions.

   * Outer loop: passed in `episodes` list of nested dictionaries
   * Inner loop: "episode" dictionary items

2. Implement the necessary conditional logic to convert the passed in dictionary values to the
   specified types, delegating to the  `utl.convert_*` functions the task of converting strings to
   either `int`, `float`, or `list` per the conversion chart below.

   | Conversion | value(s) | Delegate to | Notes |
   | :--------- | :------- | :---------- | :---- |
   | `str` to `int` | 'series_season_num', 'series_episode_num', 'season_episode_num' | sw_utils.convert_to_int() | Blank values are converted to `None` if `utl.convert_to_none` is called by `utl.convert_to_int`. |
   | `str` to `float` | 'episode_prod_code', 'episode_us_viewers_mm' | sw_utils.convert_to_float() | Blank values are converted to `None` if `utl.convert_to_none` is called by `utl.convert_to_float`. |
   | `str` to `list` | 'episode_writers' | sw_utils.convert_to_list() | |

3. After the outer loop terminates return the list of mutated dictionaries to the caller.

## 9.4.2 Call function

After implementing `convert_episode_values`, return to `main`. Call the function passing the
   `clone_wars_episodes` list as the argument. Assign the return value to `clone_wars_episodes`.

## 9.4.3 Write to file

Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `clone_wars_episodes` to the file
`stu-clone_wars-episodes_converted.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
`fxt-clone_wars-episodes_converted.json`. Both files _must_ match, line-for-line, and
character-for-character.

## 9.5 Challenge 05

__Task__: Implement functions to retrieve the most viewed episode(s) of the first two
seasons of _The Clone Wars_.

## 9.5.1 `get_most_viewed_episode` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that finds the most viewed _Clone Wars_ episode(s) in the data
set. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters
it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ return a list of one or more episodes from the passed in `episodes` list
   with the highest recorded viewership. Includes in the list only those episodes that tie for
   the highest recorded viewership. If no ties exist only one episode will be returned in the
   list. Ignores episodes with no viewership value.

2. Delegate to `has_viewer_data` the task of checking whether an episode contains a _truthy_
   "episode_us_viewers_mm" value. You need to check if "episode_us_viewers_mm" has a value before
   you attempt to compare the current "episode_us_viewers_mm" value to the previous value.

   :bulb: Assign two local "accumulator" variables to the viewer count and the top episode(s).

## 9.5.2 Call function

After implementing `get_most_viewed_episode` return to `main`. Call the function and pass
`clone_wars_episodes` to it as the argument. Assign the return value to `most_viewed_episode`. If
the list contains the following elements proceed to the next challenge; if not, recheck your code.

```python
[
   {
      'series_title': 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars',
      'series_season_num': 1,
      'series_episode_num': 2,
      'season_episode_num': 2,
      'episode_title': 'Rising Malevolence',
      'episode_director': 'Dave Filoni',
      'episode_writers': ['Steven Melching'],
      'episode_release_date': 'October 3, 2008',
      'episode_prod_code': 1.07,
      'episode_us_viewers_mm': 4.92
      },
   {
      'series_title': 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars',
      'series_season_num': 2, 'series_episode_num': 45,
      'season_episode_num': 23,
      'episode_title': 'Test Record',
      'episode_director': 'Anthony Whyte',
      'episode_writers': ['Anthony Whyte', 'Chris Teplovs'],
      'episode_release_date': 'May 7, 2010',
      'episode_prod_code': 2.22,
      'episode_us_viewers_mm': 4.92
   }
]
```

## 9.6 Challenge 06

__Task__: Construct a dictionary of directors and a count of the number of episodes each directed
during the first two seasons of _The Clone Wars_.

## 9.6.1 `count_episodes_by_director` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a dictionary of key-value pairs that associate each
director in the `episodes` list of nested dictionaries with a count of the episodes that they are
credited with directing. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to
perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ accumulates episode counts for each director listed in the `eposides` list.

2. The director's name comprises the key and the associated value a count of the
number of episodes they directed. Implement conditional logic to ensure that each director
is assigned a key and the episode counts are properly tabulated and assigned as the value.

```python
{
   < director_name_01 >: < episode_count >,
   < director_name_02 >: < episode_count >,
   ...
}
```

## 9.6.2 Call function

After implementing `count_episodes_by_director` return to `main`. Call the function and pass
`clone_wars_episodes` to it as the argument. Assign the return value to `director_episode_counts`.

## 9.6.2 Write to file

Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `director_episode_counts` to the file
`stu-clone_wars-director_episode_counts.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
`fxt-clone_wars-director_episode_counts.json`. Both files _must_ match, line-for-line, and
character-for-character.

## 9.7 Challenge 07

__Task__: Implement the function `get_nyt_news_desks`.

## 9.7.1 `get_nyt_news_desks` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a list of New York Times "news desks" sourced from the
passed in `articles` list. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to
perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

:bulb: Each article dictionary contains a "news_desk" key-value pair.

### Requirements

1. The list of news desk names returned by the function _must not_ contain any duplicate elements.
   Accumulate the values carefully.

2. The function must delegate to the function `utl.convert_to_none` the task of converting
   "news_desk" values that equal "None" (a string) to `None`. Only news_desk values that are
   "truthy" (i.e., not None) are to be returned in the list.

    :bulb: There are eight (8) articles with a "news_desk" value of "None". Exclude this
    value from the list by passing each "news_desk" value to `utl.convert_to_none` and assigning
    the return value to a local variable. You can filter out the `None` values with a truth value
    test.

## 9.7.2 Call function

After implementing `get_nyt_news_desks` return to `main`. Call the function `utl.read_json` and
retrieve the New York Times article data in the file `./nyt_star_wars_articles.json`. Assign the
return value to `articles`.

Test your implementation of `get_nyt_news_desks` by calling the function and passing to it the
argument `articles`. Assign the return value to the variable `news_desks`.

## 9.7.3 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `news_desks` to the file
`stu-nyt_news_desks.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file`fxt-nyt_news_desks.json`. The
files _must_ match line-for-line and character-for-character.

## 9.8 Challenge 08

__Task__: Implement the function `group_nyt_articles_by_news_desk`.

## 9.8.1 `group_nyt_articles_by_news_desk` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a dictionary of "news desk" key-value pairs that
group the passed in `articles` by their parent news desk drawn from the `news_desks` list. Review
the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Implement a nested loop. Review the `nyt_star_wars_articles.json` and `stu-nyt_news_desks.json`
   files and decide which list should be traversed by the outer loop and which list should be
   traversed by the inner loop.

   :bulb: The news desk name provides the link between the two lists.

2. Assign an empty list to a local variable. You will accumulate article dictionaries in this list
   and then assign the list to its "parent" news desk key. There are three locations in the function
   block where this initial variable assignment could be placed: outside the loops, inside the outer
   loop, or inside the inner loop. Choose wisely.

3. Each article dictionary added to its parent news desk list represents a "thinned" version of the
   original. The keys to employ and their order is illustrated by the example below:

   ```python
   {
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/business/media/lucasfilm-sues-jedi-classes.html",
      "headline_main": "Classes for Jedis Run Afoul of the Lucasfilm Empire",
      "news_desk": "Business",
      "byline_original": "By Erin McCann",
      "document_type": "article",
      "material_type": "News",
      "abstract": "A man whose businesses offers private lessons and certifications for fine-tuning lightsaber skills is operating without the permission of the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù owner.",
      "word_count": 865,
      "pub_date": "2016-10-19T13:26:21+0000"
   }
   ```

   :exclamation: Certain keys such as "headline_main", "byline_original", and "material_type" are
   not found in the original New York Times dictionaries. Hopefully, the names provide a sufficient
   hint about which values to map (i.e., assign) to each.

## 9.8.2 Call function

After implementing `nyt_star_wars_articles.json` return to `main`. Call the function and pass it
`news_desks` and `articles` as arguments. Assign the return value to the variable
`news_desk_articles`.

## 9.8.3 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `news_desk_articles` to the file
`stu-nyt_news_desk_articles.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
`fxt-nyt_news_desk_articles.json`. The files _must_ match line-for-line and character-for-character.

## 9.9 Challenge 09

__Task__ Implement the function `calculate_articles_mean_word_count`

## 9.9.1 `calculate_articles_mean_word_count` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns the mean (e.g., average) word count of the passed in
list of `articles` less any articles with a word count of zero (0). Review the function's docstring
to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

__mean__: central value of a set of values that is determined by calculating
_the sum of the values divided by the number of values_.

__Requirements__

1. The function _must_ calculate the mean word count of the passed in articles __excluding__ from
   the calculation all articles with a word count of zero (0).

2. Accumulate the news desk article word counts and assign the running count to a local variable.

3. Maintain a local count of the number of news desk articles with a word count of zero (`0`). You
   will need to subtract this number from the total number of articles passed to the function to
   ensure that the divisor reflects the actual number of articles upon which to compute the mean. An
   `if-else` block is your friend here.

4. You _must_ __round__ the mean value to the second (2nd) decimal place before returning the value
   to the caller.

## 9.9.2 Call function

After implementing `calculate_articles_mean_word_count` return to `main`. Create an empty dictionary
named `mean_word_counts`. You will use it to accumulate mean words counts.

Loop over the `news_desk_articles` key-value pairs. Write a conditional statement inside the loop
block that checks if the current key is a member of the `ignore` news desks tuple. If the key is
__not__ a member call the function `calculate_articles_mean_word_count` and pass it the list of
articles mapped (i.e., assigned) to the key.

Inside the loop add a new key-value pair to `mean_word_counts` consisting of the current key and
the return value of the call to `calculate_articles_mean_word_count`. Below is one of the key-value
pairs added to `mean_word_counts` that your code _must_ produce:

```python
{
   "Obits": 823.14,
   ...
}
```

## 9.9.3 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `mean_word_counts` to the file
`stu-nyt_news_desk_mean_word_counts.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
`fxt-nyt_news_desk_mean_word_counts.json`. The files _must_ match line-for-line and
character-for-character.

## 9.10 Challenge 10

__Task__: Implement the function `utl.convert_gravity_value`.

## 9.10.1 `utl.convert_gravity_value` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert a planet's "gravity" value to a float by
first removing the "standard" unit of measure substring (if it exists) before converting the
remaining number to a float. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to
perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

:bulb: Note that "gravity" values vary from planet to planet. The following examples illustrate
the challenge:

```python
{
    'name': Tatooine,
    ...
    'gravity': '1 standard',
    ...
}
```

```python
{
   'name': Dagobah,
    ...,
    'gravity': 'N/A',
    ...
}
```

```python
{
    'name': Haruun Kal,
    ...
    'gravity': '0.98',
    ...
}
```

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions
   whenever an invalid type conversion is attempted. __Do not__ place code outside the `try`/`except`
   code blocks.

2. The function _must_ __remove__ the substring "standard" if it exists anywhere in the passed in
   `value` _irrespective of case_. In other words lowercase, mixed case, and uppercase versions of
   the substring must be removed.

3. If the substring exists in `value`, remove it and return a version of `value` that contains only
   the numeric portion of the string.

   :bulb: a handy `str` method exists for locating substrings in a string.

   :exclamation: Don't assume that `value` is "clean"; program defensively and remove
   leading/trailing spaces before attempting to convert the "cleaned" version of the string to a
   float.

4. The function _must_ delegate to the function `utl.convert_to_float` the task of converting the
   "numeric" version of `value` to a float. The return value of `utl.convert_to_float` is then
   returned to the caller.

5. If a runtime exception is encountered the `except` block will "catch" the exception, pass the
   `value` to the function `utl.convert_to_none`, and then return the value returned by
   `utl.convert_to_none` to the caller.

## 9.10.2 Call function

After implementing `convert_gravity_value` return to `main`. Test your implementation by calling
the function from inside `print()` and passing to it different test values such as "1 standard",
"N/A", and the list `0.98`.

```python
print(f"\nconvert_gravity_value -> float = {utl.convert_gravity_value('1 standard')}")
print(f"\nconvert_gravity_value -> None = {utl.convert_gravity_value('N/A')}")
print(f"\nconvert_gravity_value -> float = {utl.convert_gravity_value('0.98')}")

```

## 9.11 Challenge 11

__Task__: Implement the function `get_wookieepedia_data`.

## 9.11.1 `get_wookieepedia_data` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that utilizes a `filter` string to return a nested dictionary from
the passed in `wookiee_data` list if the dictionary's "name" value matches the `filter` value.
Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

The function can be employed to traverse lists of nested dictionaries sourced from the
following files in search of a particular dictionary representation of a Star Wars droid,
person, planet, or starship:

* `wookieepedia_droids.json`
* `wookieepedia_people.json`
* `wookieepedia_planets.csv`
* `wookieepedia_starships.csv`

### Requirements

1. The function must perform a __case insenstitive__ comparison between the passed in `filter`
   value and each nested dictionary's "name" value. If a match is obtained it returns the nested
   dictionary to the caller.

2. If no match is obtained the function returns `None` to the caller.

## 9.11.2 Call function

In `main` call the `utl.read_csv_to_dicts` function and retrieve the supplementary
Wookieepedia planet data in the file `wookieepedia_planets.csv`. Assign the return value to
`wookiee_planets`.

Call the function `get_wookieepedia_data` and pass to it as arguments `wookiee_planets` and the
_lowercase_ string "dagobah". Assign the return value to the variable `wookiee_dagobah`.

Call the function a second time and pass to it as arguments `wookiee_planets` and the
_uppercase_ string "HARUUN KAL". Assign the return value to the variable `wookiee_haruun_kal`.

## 9.11.3 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `wookiee_dagobah` to the
file `stu-wookiee_dagobah.json`. Call `utl.write_json` a second time and write `wookiee_haruun_kal`
to the file `stu-wookiee_haruun_kal.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture files
`fxt-wookiee_dagobah.json` and `fxt-wookiee_haruun_kal.json`. The files _must_ match line-for-line
and character-for-character.

## 9.12 Challenge 12

__Task__: Implement the function `create_planet`.

:bulb: This challenge's workflow illustrates the general creational pattern applied to each droid,
person, planet, species, and starship encountered in later challenges.

* retrieve SWAPI data
* combine with Wookieepedia data
* create new dictionary instance that retains a subset of the passed in key-value pairs,
  occasionally substituting in new keys and converting certain values to more appropriate types
  (e.g., `str` to `int`).
* write to file (i.e., check your work)

:exclamation: The SWAPI data will serve as the default representation of the entities that feature
in the assignment. The Wookieepedia data will be used to enrich the SWAPI data with new and updated
key-value pairs.

:exclamation: The starship _Twilight_ is sourced from Wookieepedia only. No SWAPI representation of
the light freighter exists.

## 9.12.1 `create_planet` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a new planet dictionary based on the passed in `data`
dictionary. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the
parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

Certain `data` values require special handling and are subject to the following type conversion
rules:

1. Convert all `data` values to `None` that match any of the `utl.NONE_VALUES` items
   (case-insensitive match of strings stripped of leading/trailing spaces). This can be accomplished
   by judicious use of the `utl.convert_to_*` functions.

2. Convert other `data` values to `int`, `float` or `list` as specified in the table below.

   :exclamation: The new dictionary may contain keys that differ from the passed in `data`
   dictionary keys.

   | `data` | Convert to | Notes |
   | :----- | :------ | :---- |
   | suns (`str`) | suns (`int`) | |
   | moons (`str`) | moons (`int`) | |
   | orbital_period (`str`) | orbital_period_days (`float`) | |
   | diameter (`str`) | diameter_km (`int`) | |
   | gravity (`str`) | gravity_std (`float`) | |
   | climate (`str`) | climate (`list`) | |
   | terrain (`str`) | terrain (`list`) | |
   | population (`str`) | population (`int`) | |

After implementing `create_planet` return to `main`. Call the function `get_resource` and retrieve
a SWAPI representation of the planet [Tatooine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine). Access
the "Tatooine" dictionary which is stored in the response object and assign the value to
`swapi_tatooine`.

:bulb: The `sw_utils` module includes a SWAPI "planets" URL constant that you can pass as the
`url` argument. If you need help constructing the `params` argument review the lecture notes and
code.

Call `get_wookieepedia_data` passing it the appropriate arguments and retrieve the "Tatooine"
dictionary in `wookiee_planets`. Assign the return value to `wookiee_tatooine`. Check the truth
value of `wookiee_tatooine`. If "truthy" update `swapi_tatooine` with `wookiee_tatooine`.

Call the function `create_planet()` and pass the updated `swapi_tatooine` as the argument. Assign
the return value to a variable named `tatooine`.

## 9.12.3 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `tatooine` to the file
`stu-tatooine.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file `fxt-tatooine.json`. Both files

__Task__: Implement the function `create_species`.

## 9.14.1 `create_species` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a new species dictionary based on the passed in
`data` dictionary. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform,
the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

Certain `data` values require special handling and are subject to the following type conversion
rules:

1. Convert all `data` values to `None` that match any of the `utl.NONE_VALUES` items
   (case-insensitive match of strings stripped of leading/trailing spaces). This can be accomplished

   available locally. |

   <br />

3. :exclamation: The person's "homeworld" value _must_ be converted to a dictionary representation
   of the home planet. Implement the following steps in your code to produce the required
   "homeworld" key-value pairs:

   1. Retrieve the planet dictionary from the cache or from SWAPI if the data is not available
      locally.

   2. If an optional Wookieepedia-sourced `planets` list is provided call `get_wookieepedia_data`

## 9.16.2 Create the light freighter _Twilight_

After implementing `create_starship` return to `main`. Call the `utl.read_csv_to_dicts` function
and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia starship data in the file `wookieepedia_starships.csv`.
Assign the return value to `wookiee_starships`.

Call `get_wookieepedia_data` passing the appropriate arguments and retrieve the light freigter
named [_Twilight_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight) in `wookiee_starships`. Assign the
return value to a variable named `wookiee_twilight`.

:exclamation: The starship _Twilight_ is sourced from Wookieepedia only. No SWAPI representation of
the light freighter exists.

Call the function `create_starship()` and pass `wookiee_twilight` to it as the argument. Assign the
return value to a variable named `twilight`.

## 9.16.3 Write to file

Check your work. Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `twilight` to the file

Both files _must_ match line-for-line and character-for-character.

## 9.17 Challenge 17

__Task__: Implement the function `board_passengers`. Get Senator Padm√© Amidala, the protocol
droid C-3PO, and the astromech droid R2-D2 aboard the _Twilight_ as passengers.

## 9.17.1 `board_passengers` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that assigns passengers to a starship. Review the function's
docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return
value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The passengers _must_ be passed in a list to the `board_passengers` function.

2. The number of passengers permitted to board a starship is limited by the starship's
   "max_passengers" value. If the number of passengers attempting to board exceeds the starship's
   "max_passengers" value only the first `n` passengers (where `n` = "max_passengers") are permitted
   to board the vessel. This limitation _must_ be imposed by the `board_passengers` function and
   will be subject to auto grader testing.

   For example, if a starship's "max_passengers" value equals `10` and `20` passengers attempt to
   board the starship, only the first `10` passengers are permitted to board the vessel.

3. After boarding the passengers return the starship to the caller.

## 9.17.2 Get passengers aboard the _Twilight_

> R2 are you quite certain that the ship is in this direction? This way looks potentially dangerous. _C-3PO_

After implementing `board_passengers` return to `main`. Create a dictionary representation of the
Galactic senator [Padm√© Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala). Utilize the
same "creational" workflow employed to create the dictionary representation of Anakin Skywalker.
Consider using the following variable names to represent Padm√©.

* `swapi_padme` (assigned to the SWAPI dictionary data)
* `wookiee_padme` (assigned to the Wookieepedia dictionary data)
* `padme` (assigned to the `create_person` return value)

Create a dictionary representation of the protocol droid named
[C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO). Utilize the same "creational" workflow employed to
create R2-D2. Consider using the following variable names to represent C-3PO.

* `swapi_c_3po` (assigned to the SWAPI dictionary data)
* `wookiee_c_3po` (assigned to the Wookieepedia dictionary data)
* `c_3po` (assigned to the `create_droid` return value)

Call the function `board_passengers` and pass the following arguments to it:

* `twilight`
* a list of passengers comprising `padme`, `c_3po`, and `r2_d2` (in that order).

Assign the return value to the variable `twilight`.

:bulb: Test your function by passing additional passengers to it in excess of the permitted
"max_passengers" value. Consider creating dictionary representations of the Jedi masters
[Mace Windo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mace_Windu),
[Plo Koon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Plo_Koon),
[Shaak Ti](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shaak_Ti), and
[Yoda](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yoda) and attempt to add them as extra passengers. You can
retrieve both SWAPI and Wookieepedia dictionary representations of each to use for testing.

## 9.18 Challenge 18

> Let's get back to the ship. Power up the engines R2. _Anakin Skywalker_

__Task__: Implement the function `assign_crew_members`. Assign Anakin Skywalker and
Obi-Wan Kenobi to the _Twilight_ as crew members.

## 9.18.1 `assign_crew_members` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that assigns personnel by position (e.g., pilot, copilot) to a
starship using a dictionary comprehension. Review the function's docstring to better understand the
task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. To earn full credit you _must_ create the "crew_members" dictionary by writing a
   __dictionary comprehension__ on a __single line__.

   :exclamation: If necessary write a "conventional" `for` loop that adds the "crew_member"
   key-value pairs to an accumulation dictionary named `crew_members`. Get it working and then
   convert it to a dictionary comprehension.

2. The crew positions (e.g., 'pilot') and personnel (e.g., Anakin Skywalker) must be passed in
   separate lists to the function `assign_crew_members`.

3. The number of crew members that can be assigned to the starship is limited by the starship's
   "crew_size" value. No additional crew members are permitted to be assigned to the starship even
   if included in the `crew_positions` and `personnel` lists. This limitation _must_ be imposed by
   the `assign_crew_members` function and will be subject to auto grader testing.

   For example, if a starship's "crew_size" value equals `3` but `4` crew positions/personnel are
   passed to the function only the first `3` crew positions and personnel are permitted to be added
   as key-value pairs to the crew members dictionary.

4. Both the passed in `crew_positions` and `personnel` lists should contain the same number of
   elements. The individual `crew_positions` and `personnel` elements are then paired by index
   position and stored in a dictionary structured as follows:

   ```python
   {< crew_position[0] >: < personnel[0] >, < crew_position[1] >: < personnel[1] >, ...}
   ```

5. Map (i.e., assign) the new dictionary to a new starship key named "crew_members" before returning
   the crewed starship to the caller.

   :bulb: Avoid looping over the passed in lists. Instead loop over a sequence of numbers and think
   carefully about the appropriate stop value to employ in order to limit the number of loop
   iterations. Utilize the sequence of numbers to pair `crew_position` and `personnel` elements by
   their matching index position.

## 9.18.2 Assign crew members to the _Twilight_

After implementing `assign_crew_members` return to `main`. Create a dictionary representation of the
the [Jedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi) General
[Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi). Utilize the same "creational"
workflow employed to create the other people. Consider using the following variable names to
represent Obi-Wan.

* `swapi_obi_wan` (assigned to the SWAPI dictionary data)
* `wookiee_obi_wan` (assigned to the Wookieepedia dictionary data)
* `obi_wan` (assigned to the `create_person` return value)

Next, call the function `assign_crew_members` and pass the following arguments to it:

* `twilight`
* a crew positions list comprising the following string elements: "pilot" and "copilot"
* a personnel list comprising `anakin` and `obi_wan`

Assign the return value to the variable `twilight`.

:bulb: Test your function by passing additional crew positions and personnel to it
in excess of the permitted "crew_size" value. Consider creating dictionary representations of the
Jedi masters [Mace Windo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mace_Windu),
[Plo Koon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Plo_Koon),
[Shaak Ti](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shaak_Ti), or
[Yoda](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yoda) and attempt to assign one or more as extra crew
members. You can retrieve both SWAPI and Wookieepedia dictionary representations of each to use for
testing.

## 9.18.3 Issue instructions to R2-D2

Create a list containing Anakin's "Power up the engines" order (a string) and map (i.e., assign) it
to the droid `r2_d2's` "instructions" key.

## 10.0 Finis

> R2 release the docking clamp. _Anakin Skywalker_

## 10.0.1 Issue instructions to R2-D2

Add Anakin's order "Release the docking clamp" to `r2_d2's` "instructions" key-value pair.

## 10.0.2 Escape from the Malevolence

With our heroes on board the _Twilight_ and the engines fired, the light freighter detaches
itself from the stricken heavy cruiser _Malevolence_ and departs to rejoin the Republican fleet.

Call the function `utl.write_json` and write `twilight` to the file
`stu-twilight_departs.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file `fxt-twilight_departs.json`.
Both files _must_ match line-for-line and character-for-character.

Your job is done. Never mind that Separatist starfighters are in hot pursuit of the _Twilight_;
declare victory.

Congratulations on completing SI 506.
