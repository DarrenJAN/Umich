## TOPICS

1. JSON
2. `json` module
3. Nested loops

## Vocabulary

* __Nested Loop__. A `for` or `while` loop located within the code block of another loop.

## 1.0 JSON

[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data
interchange format for exchanging information between systems.

JSON consists of two basic data structures and several value types.

## 1.1 JSON data structures

1. An _unordered_ set of name-value pairs known as an _object_ and denoted by curly braces (`{}`).
2. An _ordered_ list of values known as an _array_ and denoted by square brackets (`[]`).

## 1.2 JSON value types

1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. array `[]`
5. object `{}`
6. null

## 1.3 JSON example

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) provides an
[Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview)
(Application Programming Interface) that permits keyword searching and retrieval of JSON
representations of NY Times articles. Below is a example of one such JSON document.

:bulb: Certain name-value pairs have been removed from the JSON document below
in the interests of brevity. For instance only the top 3 keywords (out of 10) have been
included in the example.

```json
{
  "abstract": "Ten years ago, psychologists proposed that a wide range of people would suffer anxiety and grief over climate. Skepticism about that idea is gone.",

## 2.0 json module

Like the `csv` module the Python standard libary's `json` module provides enhanced functionality for
working with JSON files. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format for exchanging information
between systems.

To use the `json` module you must import it:

```python
import json
```

There are four `json` module functions; two of which are of particular interest to us:

| Function | Purpose |
| :------- | :------ |
| __`json.load()`__ | _Deserializes_ (decodes) a text or binary file that contains a JSON document to a `dict` or `list`. |
| __`json.dump()`__ | _Serializes_ (encodes) an object as a JSON formatted stream to be stored in a file. |
| `json.loads()` | _Deserializes_ (decodes) a string, bytes, or bytearray containing a JSON document to a `dict` or `list`. |
| `json.dumps()` | _Serializes_ (encodes) an object to a JSON formatted string. |

Since you will also be working with JSON documents between now and the end of the semester
implmenting a function that can read a JSON document as well one that can write a JSON document to
a file will prove useful.

## 2.1 Reading JSON files (`json_load()`)

The function `read_json()` reads a JSON document per the provided filepath, calls the json module's
`json.load()` function in order to _decode_ the file data as a `dict` or a `list` (of dictionaries),
before returning the decoded data to the caller.

```python
def read_json(filepath, encoding='utf-8'):
    """Reads a JSON document, decodes the file content, and returns a list or dictionary if
    provided with a valid filepath.

    Parameters:
        filepath (str): path to file
        encoding (str): name of encoding used to decode the file

    Returns:
        dict/list: dict or list representations of the decoded JSON document
    """

    with open(filepath, 'r', encoding=encoding) as file_obj:
        return json.load(file_obj)
```

## 2.2 Writing to a JSON file (`json_dump()`)

The function `write_json()` accepts a dictionary or a list of dictionaries, calls the json module's
`json.dump()` function in order to _encode_ the passed in data as JSON before writing the encoded
data to the target file.

```python
def write_json(filepath, data, encoding='utf-8', ensure_ascii=False, indent=2):
    """Serializes object as JSON. Writes content to the provided filepath.

    Parameters:
        filepath (str): the path to the file
        data (dict)/(list): the data to be encoded as JSON and written to the file
        encoding (str): name of encoding used to encode the file
        ensure_ascii (str): if False non-ASCII characters are printed as is; otherwise
                            non-ASCII characters are escaped.
        indent (int): number of "pretty printed" indention spaces applied to encoded JSON

    Returns:
        None
    """

    with open(filepath, 'w', encoding=encoding) as file_obj:
        json.dump(data, file_obj, ensure_ascii=ensure_ascii, indent=indent)
```

## Challenge 01

__Task__: Read in the NY Times JSON article data, extract articles written in 2022, and write the
articles that meet the filter condition to a file as JSON.

1. In `main` call the function `read_json` and provide it with the appropriate filepath in order to
   retrieve NY Times Science Desk articles filtered on the subject "Psychology and Psychologists".
   Assign the return value to a variable named `articles`.

2. Loop over `articles` and in the loop block write an `if` statement that identifies
   articles with a publication year of 2022. Append each 2022 article to a list (name your choice).

   :bulb: Review the JSON file `nyt-article-example.json` for the appropriate publication date
   name-value pair in order to derive the dictionary key name to use in your `if` statement.

   :exclamation: Each article contains an [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date
   formatted string as the following example illustrates:

   ```commandline
   2022-02-06T10:00:12+0000
   ```

   :bulb: In your `if` statement utilize a `str` method to access the year portion (i.e., "2022") of
   the string. Alternative approaches could involve use of the `datetime` module or the third-party
   library [`dateutil`](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but these are out-of-scope for
   this challenge.

3. After exiting the loop, call the function `write_json` and write the "accumulator" list encoded
   as JSON to a file named `stu-nyt-articles-2022.json`.

## 3.0 Nested loops

What if you were asked to identify articles in the `articles` list that possess one or more
keywords? Note, that each JSON document representing a NY Times article contains a list of keyword
objects. For example a 2018 article by Paula Span entitled
["Dementia Is Getting Some Very Public Faces"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/health/alzheimers-dementia-celebrities.html)
includes the following "keywords" JSON list:

```json
"keywords": [
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Alzheimer's Disease", "rank": 1, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Elderly", "rank": 2, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Dementia", "rank": 3, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Psychology and Psychologists", "rank": 4, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Disabilities", "rank": 5, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "subject", "value": "Celebrities", "rank": 6, "major": "N"},
  {"name": "persons", "value": "O'Connor, Sandra Day", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}
]
```

If we wanted to return articles in the `articles` list that where tagged with either "Dementia"
and/or "Alzheimer's Disease" we could write a function that performs a keyword
look up (e.g., `has_keywords(keywords, filters)` and then call it from inside a `for` loop
in order to identify dementia-related articles. Alternatively, we could implement a
nested loop.

:bulb: # [Dementia](https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/what-is-dementia) is a generic
term that a range of neurological conditions impacting the brain including Alzheimer's Disease.

A nested loop refers to a loop located within the code block of another loop. During each
iteration of the "outer" loop, the "inner" loop will execute, completing all its iterations (unless
terminated early) _prior_ to the outer loop commencing its next iteration, if any.

```commandline
for < element > in < sequence >:
    # indented block
    for < element > in < element (itself a sequence) >
        < statement A >
        < statement B >
        ...
```

The following example illustrates the pattern in action. The outer loop iterates  over the
`articles` list. The inner loop iterates over each article's "keywords" list. If the keyword is a
subject keyword and the keyword value is either "Alzheimer's Disease" or "Dementia" a match is
obtained and the article is appended to the list `dementia_articles`.

:exclamation: The data set contains five (`5`) keyword "name" values: "subject", "glocations",
"organizations", "persons", and "creative_works" so filtering on "subject" is required.

:bulb: Note the use of the `break` statement inside the inner loop. Since an article can
contain both keyword objects it is imperative that no additional loop iterations occur after the
first match is obtained in order to avoid duplicate append operations.

```python
# Get all articles touching on Dementia
dementia = []
for article in articles:
    for keyword in article['keywords']:
        if keyword['name'] == 'subject' and keyword['value'] in ("Alzheimer's Disease", 'Dementia'):
            dementia.append(article)
            break # avoid appending duplicates due to either/or membership check

# Write to file
write_json('stu-nyt-dementia-articles.json', dementia_articles)
```

## Challenge 02

__Task__: Return a list of _unique_ keyword values and write the results to a text file.

1. In `main`, create an empty list named `subjects`. Then implement a nested loop that iterates over
   each article's keywords list.

2. Inside the nested loop block, write an `if` statement that encompasses the following two
   conditions:

   1. The keyword dictionary's "name" value equals "subject", and
   2. The keyword dictionary's "value" is not a member of `subjects`

   If both conditions return `True` append the keyword "value" to the `subjects` list.

3. After exiting the outer loop write the `subjects` list to a text file named `stu-subjects.txt`.
   Employ a `with open()` statement to accomplish the task.

   :bulb: If you forget how to write a list to a text file review __lecture 12, section 3.5__.

   __Requirements__
   1. _Prior_ to writing the list to a file.Perform an alphanumeric sort of the list using the
      built-in function `sorted()`.

   2. :exclamation: Be sure to add a trailing `\n` newline to every string element written to
      the file in order to avoid writing each string to a single line.

      ```commandline
      #MeToo Movement
      ANOREXIA NERVOSA
      ANTIDEPRESSANTS
      Addiction (Psychology)
      Advertising and Marketing
      ...
      ```

      not

      ```commandline
      #MeToo MovementANOREXIA NERVOSAANTIDEPRESSANTSAddiction (Psychology)Advertising and Marketing ...
      ```

## Challenge 03

__Task__: Obtain keyword subject counts across all articles. Store in a dictionary and write
to a file as JSON.

1. In `main`, create an empty dictionary named `subject_counts`. Then implement a nested loop that
   iterates over the `subjects`, `articles`, and `keyword` lists in order to obtain the subject
   counts to be assigned to `subject_counts` as key-value pairs.

   __Requirements__

   1. Your solution _must_ feature three (3) loops, two of which are nested.

       1. Outer: Loop over each subject (`str`) in `subjects`.

       2. Inner (1): Loop over each article (`dict`) in `articles`.

       3. Inner (2): Loop over each keyword (`dict`) in the article's keywords (`list`). Each
          keyword dictionary contains the following key-value pairs:

        ```python
        {
            'name': 'subject',
            'value': 'Therapy and Rehabilitation',
            'rank': 5,
            'major': "N"
        }
        ```

   2. Inside the innermost loop implement the following conditional logic to either add a new
      key-value pair _or_ increment an existing key-value pair in the `subject_counts` dictionary:

      * Check whether or not the keyword "name" value equals "subject" _and_ the keyword "value"
        value equals the outer loop subject element string.

      * If the above compound condition resolves to `True` then _inside_ the `if` statement block,
        check if the outer loop subject element matches a key in the `subject_counts` `dict_keys`
        object.

        ```python
        if < expressions >:
            if < expression >:
                ...
            ...
        ```

        If the key is _not_ found in the `dict_keys` object, either

        * add a _new_ key-value pair assigning the subject element as the key and `1` as the
          value, _or_

        * increment an existing key-value pair (i.e., with a key name that matches the outer loop's
          subject element string) by `1`.

2. After exiting the outer loop uncomment the dictionary comprehension in order to return a new
   dictionary `subject_counts` with key-value pairs sorted by value (descending order) and then by
   key (alphanumeric, ascending order).

3. Call the function `write_json` and write `subject_counts` encoded as JSON to a file named
   `stu-nyt-subject_counts.json`.

## Challenge 04

__Task__: Refactor the Challenge 03 nested loop by relocating the innermost loop's keyword "name"
and "value" check to a function named `has_subject`. Then obtain keyword subject counts across all
articles. Store in a dictionary and write to a file as JSON.

1. In `main`, create an empty dictionary named `subject_counts_fx`. Then implement a nested loop
   that iterates over the `subjects` and `articles` in order to obtain the subject counts to be
   assigned to `subject_counts` as key-value pairs.

2. Implement the function named `has_subject`. The function defines two parameters:

   * subjects (`list`): list of "subject" string elements
   * subject (`str`): string to locate in the `subjects` list

   If the passed in `subject` is found in the passed in `subjects` list, the boolean `True` is
   returned by the function to the caller; otherwise `False` is returned.

   :bulb: Transfer the following conditional logic to the function implemented in the innermost
   loop in the previous Challenge code:

   * Check whether or not the keyword "name" value equals "subject" _and_ the keyword "value" value
     equals the outer loop subject element string.

3. After implementing the function `has_subject` return to `main`. Loop over the `subjects` and
   `articles` lists as in the previous challenge. However _replace_ the innermost article keywords
   loop with an `if` statement that encompasses a call to the function `has_subject`.

4. If the above condition resolves to `True` then _inside_ the `if` statement block, incorporate
   the same conditonal logic employed in the previous challenge to either

   * add a _new_ key-value pair assigning the subject element as the key and `1` as the value, _or_

   * increment an existing key-value pair (i.e., with a key name that matches the outer loop's
     subject element string) by `1`.

5. After exiting the outer loop uncomment the dictionary comprehension in order to return a new
   dictionary `subject_counts_fx` with key-value pairs sorted by value (descending order) and then by
   key (alphanumeric, ascending order).

6. Uncomment the `assert` statement to confirm that `subject_counts` is the equivalent of
   `subject_counts_fx`. If `False` a runtime exception will be generated.
