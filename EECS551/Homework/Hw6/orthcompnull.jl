R = orthcompnull(A, X)
Project each column of `X` onto the orthogonal complement of the null space
of the input matrix `A`.
In:
* `A` `M Ã— N` matrix
* `X` vector of length `N`, or matrix with `N` rows and many columns
Out:
* `R` : vector or matrix of size ??? (you determine this)
For full credit, your solution should be computationally efficient!
